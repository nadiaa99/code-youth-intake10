    <p id="p2">It's a new day and Ayaan has woken up on the wrong side of the bed, where nothing feels quite right. What if he doesn't know the answer at school? What if he messes up? But as he sets out that morning, all it takes is a few reminders from his mom and some friends in the neighborhood to remind him that a new day is a good day because...
        HE IS SMART,
        HE IS BLESSED,
        AND HE CAN DO ANYTHING!</p>
